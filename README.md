# MLAnalysis
The analysis tool for various machine learning algorithms and feature engineering 

This tool is created for the data scientists who want to get a head start with their analysis, and picking the best features technically.
This helps the data scientists to save their time drastically, and leverage the computing power to do guessing and hard work, freeing the human brain to do "human analysis"
